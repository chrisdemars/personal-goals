### Week in Review
The week was rather chill. I had spurts of motivation and inspiration to work on some projects. I finally finished and launched Mark's site, [Sin Corazon Tattoos](http://sincorazontattoos.com). Pretty stoked about that. I also JS'ed a little, with the help of Stack Overflow, and finished [ngWhatTheF*ck](http://chrisdemars.github.io/ngwhatthef-ck). I filed some issues on GitHub for a couple things I couldn't figure out, but they are getting taken care of.
