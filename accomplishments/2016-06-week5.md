### Week in Review
The week was crazy and full of pressure. Things I did at work came back with defects, but the defects weren't communicated properly, so in the end the code I worked on was perfectly fine. Thursday night I went out to Ann Arbor to help organize and get ready for the GDI AA 2 year anniversary party. I will be in attendance this year, but I will be working the event as a floater working the reg table or wherever I am needed. Hopefully next week is a little less hecktic.
