### Week in Review
This week was pretty hecktic for me. I had doctors appointments per usual, but have also been slipping in to depression again and trying to catch myself before it gets really bad. I did however manager to pick up "Learn to Program" and read pages out of it, which goes towards my monthly goal. I also did laundry so that is a plus :facepunch:. I also have doing a lot more looking in to what I want to accomplish and do this year by looking up to people in my life such as Una Kravets and Marcy Sutton. I feel that by taking after them, I can pave the way for a happy and accomplished year and life.
