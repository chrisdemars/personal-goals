### Week in Review
I am kind of excited because I found out I have an interview with a company next Tuesday and I had a phone interview with another company on Thursday. It went really well and I should expect to be hearing back from them this coming week. I am still waiting on my clothes from Sullen to arrive as well as my luggage from eBags. I will be leaving for Denver in a week and a half and am super stoked about that. I am going to meet up with my buddy Scott Tolinski who runs the YouTube channel, LevelUp Tutorials to do a behind the scenes of how he makes videos with the hardware and software he uses. I also got a tattoo on Friday. Seven hours of work, start to finish. Totally worth it üëçüèª.
