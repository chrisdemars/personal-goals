Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Contribute to Open Source, specifically a11y.
2. Write more blog posts.
3. Up my JS skills.
